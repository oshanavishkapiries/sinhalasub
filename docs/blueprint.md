## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Very dark gray (#121212) to provide a cinematic, immersive experience.
- Primary color: A vibrant red (#E50914), inspired by streaming service branding, used for key interactive elements like the play button and highlights. The red is energetic but avoids overly bright tones that could distract.
- Accent color: A desaturated orange-red (#C42B1C) is used as an accent to subtly guide user actions.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font known for its modern, neutral appearance, for both headlines and body text.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying file URLs or any other code snippets.
- Use a grid-based layout for search results and carousels for categories on the home screen.
- Incorporate smooth transitions and hover effects on cards/posters, similar to Netflix, to enhance user experience.
